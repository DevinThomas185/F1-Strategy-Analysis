## Bugs

- If listening after already starting the race, using own player in race, the name does not appear in participants packet

- Tyre degradation and fuel degradation are too frequently recorded (record once per lap or a few times per lap)

- Telemetry traces sometimes randomly reset mid lap

- Fuel and tyre degradation graphs need to clear the regression lines after changing stint number / stint type / session.

- Loaded track map picture should come from the track_id, not be hard coded

## Features

- Show flags (on events announcement)
- Show marshal flags
- Put vertical lines for each turn on the graphs
- Tyre pressures in damage
- Fuel estimate for entire race
- TyreÂ strategy for entire race
- Overlay traces of telemetry
